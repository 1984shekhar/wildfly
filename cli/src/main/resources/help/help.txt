Supported commands:
connect [host]:[port]	- connect to the specified host and port (default host is localhost, default port is 9999).
help (or h)				- print this message.
quit (or q)				- quit the command line interface.

cn [node-type [=node-name (,node-type[=node-name])*]] (or /cd)	- change the current node path to the argument.
						The current node path is used as the address for the entered operations.
						If needed, entered operations can as well specify a relative to the current node path address.
						The current node path can end on node-type. In that case, to execute an operation
						just a node-name would be sufficient (e.g. logging:read-resource).
						To move to the parent node from the current one use '..' (e.g. 'cd ..').
						To move to the node type from the current node use '.type' (e.g. 'cd .type').
						The root is specified with '/' (e.g. 'cd /' or 'cd /other=thing').
						The root can only be referenced at the beginning of the node path (not in the middle).

Tab-completion is supported for the commands, just press the tab key to start
(tab-completion for command's arguments isn't supported yet).

To use tab completion for operations requests start with './' or '/' and press the tab key
which will list the available node types or names.
If the operation request doesn't require a node path then start with ':' and press the tab key
('/:' and './:' are also possible).

Operation requests are expected to follow the following format:

[node-type=node-name (, node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name ['('[name=value [, name=value]*]')']

e.g. /subsystem=web/connector=http:read-resource(recursive=1)

Whitespaces between the separators are insignificant.
If the operation doesn't require arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion for operation requests supports node types and names, operation names and the property names.
