Supported commands:
/connect [host]:[port] - connects to the specified host and port (default host is localhost, default port is 9999)
/help (or /h) - prints this message
/quit (or /q) - quit the command line interface

/prefix [node-type [=node-name [,node-type[=node-name]]]] (alias /to) - sets the node address prefix
 which is added to the operation request. The prefix can end on node-type.
 In that case, to execute an operation just a node-name would be sufficient (e.g. logging:read-resource).
 To move to the parent node from the current one use '..' (e.g. '/to ..').
 To move to the node type from the current node use 'type' (e.g. '/to .type').
 The root is specified with '~' (e.g. '/to ~' or '/to ~other=thing').
 Executing the command w/o arguments prints the current prefix.

To use tab-completion for the commands, start with '/' (tab-completion for command's arguments isn't supported yet).
Commands not prefixed with '/' are treated as operation requests.
Operation requests are expected to follow the following format:

[node-type=node-name [, node-type=node-name]*] : operation-name ([name=value [, name=value]*])

e.g. profile=production,subsystem=threads,bounded-queue-thread-pool=pool1:write-core-threads(count=0, per-cpu=20)

Whitespaces between separators are insignificant.
If the address part is not specified then the operation should start with ':' followed by the operation name.
If the operation has no arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion is supported for operations as well, that includes node types and names, operation names and their properties.
