# Server root
server=The root node of the server-level management model.
server.name=The name of this server. If not set, defaults to the runtime value of InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName().
server.extension=A list of extension modules.
server.path=A list of named filesystem paths.
server.management=Specifies the enabled management protocols for the server
server.profile=The name of the server's configuration profile.
server.subsystem=The subsystems that make up the server's profile.
server.interface=A list of named network interfaces available for use on the server.
server.socket-binding=A list of socket bindings available for use on the server.
server.system-property=A list of system properties to set on the server.
server.deployment=A list of deployments available for use on the server.

# Deployments
deployment.remove=Remove a deployment from the list of content available for use. If the deployment is currently deployed in the runtime it will first be undeployed.


# Operations
composite=An operation that executes a list of other operations as a unit.
composite.steps=A list, where each item in the list has the same structure as a simple operation request.
composite.rollback=Whether steps that successfully execute should be reverted if other steps fail at runtime. Note that if any steps modify the persistent configuration, and any of those steps fail, all steps will be reverted. Partial/incomplete changes to the persistent configuration are not allowed. So, this flag only deals with what happens if there is a problem applying an operation to the running state of a server (e.g. actually increasing the size of a runtime thread pool.)
composite.result=A list, where each item in the list is the result for the equivalently positioned item in the 'steps' parameter list
